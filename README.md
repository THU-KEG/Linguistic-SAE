# SAELing: Sparse Auto-Encoder for Linguistic Mechanism Analysis

The repository implements a system for interpreting language mechanisms using sparse autoencoders, named **SAELing**. The system aims to reveal and control the internal linguistic knowledge of large language models. We use **SAELing** to extract a large number of causal features from large language models. For details, see [Sparse Auto-Encoder Interprets Linguistic Features in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20344).
